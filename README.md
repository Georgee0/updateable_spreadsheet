# updateable_spreadsheet
The program does the following:
1. Loops over all the rows 
2. If the row is for garlic, celery, or lemons, changes the price

This means your code will need to do the following: 
1. Open the spreadsheet file. 
2. For each row, check whether the value in column A is Celery, Garlic, or Lemon. 
3. If it is, update the price in column B. 
4. Save the spreadsheet to a new file (so that you donâ€™t lose the old spreadsheet, just in case).
